### Mellokollen

[Mellokollen.se][mellokollen] is a site I developed together with [@cperriard](https://github.com/cperriard) and [@luminita](https://github.com/cperriard) with design by [@hisekaldma](http://twitter.com/hisekaldma). It's a visualization/data journalism site about Melodifestivalen, the vastly popular annual music festival which also serves as the qualification competition for the Eurovision Song Contest. <br/> [[website][mellokollen]; [open data][mellodata]]

### Kvartersregeringen / Hack for Sweden

Together with friends [@jensfinnas](http://twitter.com/jensfinnas) and [@hisekaldma](http://twitter.com/hisekaldma) I won the Best Data Visualization award at [Hack for Sweden 2014][hfs14] with an app called Kvartersregeringen. The app simulated a government election based on what voters in your own constituency would have elected. <br/>[[media 1][hfspress1]; [media 2][hfspress2]]

### pxweb

`pxweb` is an R package for interfacing with the open Web APIs of Statistics Sweden and Statistics Finland, among others. I developed the core code for the package together with [@mansmeg](https://github.com/mansmeg). <br/>[[source code][pxweb]]

### Braceana

Braceana is a lightweight, markdown-based CMS geared towards quick and easy stats publication using R-flavored markdown. It includes support for interactive graphics through [Shiny][shiny] based apps. I developed it in two days' time as a proof of concept, so feel free to contribute to the source code! <br/>[[source code][braceana-gh]; [live demo][braceana-demo]]

### Stockholm R User Group

I'm a co-founder, former board member, and active participant of [SRUG][srug]. <br/>[[talk][srugtalks]]


### iPlot

iPlot is (or perhaps rather, _was_) a R/Shiny based, interactive, browser-based application for visual inspection of data that I developed wtogether with colleague [@reinholdsson](https://github.com/reinholdsson). It was never developed any further than into the prototype stage, but is a working showcase example of how Shiny can be used for quick-and-dirty prototyping when developing analytics tools.

iPlot was based on an old version of the Shiny API and has thus since stopped lookin as beautiful as we first intended it to, but it you're sincerely interested you can still find links to the code (including screenshots!) and a half-working demo below.
