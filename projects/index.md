### Mellokollen

[Mellokollen.se][mellokollen] is a site I developed together with [@cperriard](https://github.com/cperriard) and [@luminita](https://github.com/cperriard) with design by [@hisekaldma](http://twitter.com/hisekaldma). It's a visualization/data journalism site about Melodifestivalen, the vastly popular annual music festival which also serves as the qualification competition for the Eurovision Song Contest. <br/> [[website][mellokollen]; [open data][mellodata]]

### Kvartersregeringen / Hack for Sweden

Together with friends [@jensfinnas](http://twitter.com/jensfinnas) and [@hisekaldma](http://twitter.com/hisekaldma) I won the Best Data Visualization award at [Hack for Sweden 2014][hfs14] with an app called Kvartersregeringen. The app simulated a government election based on what voters in your own constituency would have elected. <br/>[[media 1][hfspress1]; [media 2][hfspress2]]

### pxweb

`pxweb` is an R package for interfacing with the open Web APIs of Statistics Sweden and Statistics Finland, among others. I developed the core code for the package together with [@mansmeg](https://github.com/mansmeg). <br/>[[source code][pxweb]]

### Braceana

Braceana is a lightweight, markdown-based CMS geared towards quick and easy stats publication using R-flavored markdown. It includes support for interactive graphics through [Shiny][shiny] based apps. I developed it in two days' time as a proof of concept, so feel free to contribute to the source code! <br/>[[source code][braceana-gh]; [live demo][braceana-demo]]

### Stockholm R User Group

I'm a co-founder, former board member, and active participant of [SRUG][srug]. <br/>[[talk][srugtalks]]
